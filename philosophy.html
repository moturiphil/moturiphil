            In a universe devoid of inherent meaning, "Embracing the Void"
            explores the profound journey of finding purpose through
            spirituality and personal values.

          <b><u>1. Understanding the Void:</u></b>
          The concept of the void represents the absence of inherent meaning in
          the universe. For many, this realization is daunting, yet it is also
          liberating. It allows us to shape our lives according to our own
          beliefs and values rather than conforming to predefined narratives. By
          acknowledging the void, we take the first step toward crafting a life
          filled with purpose.

          In 1958 he published a piece in Venture proclaiming what he called
          "Sturgeon's Revelation"

        <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure i pl4 bl bw1 b--gold mb4">
          I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty
          years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people
          who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose
          conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same
          standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or
          crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods,
          etc. is crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science
          fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction
          conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.

          You don't have to bounce a tennis ball very far in San Francisco
          before it will hit two developers complaining about how many js
          tools/frameworks there are for development in 2015 and how much
          unneccessary complexity they add. Doing a search on twitter for 'too
          many js tools' or 'yet another js framework' returns... a lot of
          people lamenting the current state of affairs.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
          This is most likely, the wrong conversation for us as a community, to
          be having. The presence of bad tools - shouldn't discourage us from
          wanting more tools or frameworks. There are more books published in a
          single day than I will ever be able to read in my lifetime. But this
          does not make me sad. Or overwhelm me. Mostly I think about how
          excited I am to read the best books that are being published. And this
          is where we should push the conversation. How do we build better
          tools? What does that look like?
